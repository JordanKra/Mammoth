CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmammoth_description.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "mammoth_description", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "mammoth_description" with any of the following names:

    mammoth_descriptionConfig.cmake
    mammoth_description-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mammoth_description" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "mammoth_description_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "mammoth_description" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
